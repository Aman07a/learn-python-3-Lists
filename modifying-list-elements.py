# Step 1: Define a list called garden_waitlist with customers in order
garden_waitlist = ["Jiho", "Adam", "Sonny", "Alisha"]

# Step 2: Replace "Adam" with "Calla" in the garden_waitlist
garden_waitlist[1] = "Calla"

# Display the garden_waitlist after replacing "Adam" with "Calla"
print(garden_waitlist)

# Step 3: Replace "Alisha" with "Alex" using negative indexing
garden_waitlist[-1] = "Alex"

# Display the final garden_waitlist after replacing "Alisha" with "Alex"
print(garden_waitlist)
